# Setting Up your Development Environment

This reference integration supports [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
development environment with the help of [devcontainers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers)
and [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/overview). With Visual Studio
Code, Linux (Ubuntu 20.04), Windows 11 and Mac OS 14.x operating systems are
supported. Follow the steps described in the [document](./vscode_dev_env_build_and_debug.md)
to setup Visual Stuido Code development environment.

If you prefer not to use either Visual Stuido Code or Docker, then only
Linux (Ubuntu 20.04) is supported as development environment. Follow the steps
described in the [document](./linux_dev_env.md)
to setup Linux (Ubuntu 20.04) development environment.
