/* From the "Fast Models Reference Guide" (https://developer.arm.com/documentation/100964/1123/About-the-models),
 * "Programmer's View (PV) models of processors and devices work at a level
 * where functional behavior is equivalent to what a programmer would see using
 * the hardware.
 *
 * They sacrifice timing accuracy to achieve fast simulation execution speeds:
 * you can use the PV models for confirming software functionality, but you
 * must not rely on the accuracy of cycle counts, low-level component
 * interactions, or other hardware-specific behavior."
 *
 * As described above, FVPs sacrifice timing accuracy to achieve fast
 * simulation execution speeds. Therefore, we need this work around of setting
 * `configTICK_RATE_HZ` to set a higher scheduler polling rate.
 * For example, setting `configTICK_RATE_HZ` to `200` simulates scheduler polling rate
 * of `1000 Hz` or 1 tick per millisecond.
 *
 * In addition, the macro `pdMS_TO_TICKS` is defined here to match the 1 tick
 * per millisecond instead of using the macro defined in
 * `FreeRTOS-kernel/include/projdefs.h`
